# Generating random data using Python
This folder contains 5 files with classes for each sheet and one main file which executes functionalities of these classes. Each of the five files generates one sheet each with the required size of the project description with a primary key as PS number and data in 15 rows and 20 columns. This data will be used by the main project for the extraction of the final output.
The sheets generated by the main file is
* Semester marks Sheet
* Random Hobbies Sheet
* Cities Visited Sheet
* Programming Expertise Sheet
* Domain Areas Sheet
## How data is generated
* To generate each sheet a python class is defined which will generate the data and write it to the Excel file.
* Each class receives the list of PS numbers from the main file and generate the random data according to the requirement.
* Then this randomly generated data is written to the Excel file using ***openpyxl*** library of python.
## Steps To Generate data 
* Get to this folder with GUI or command line.
* Then run the file named ***main_file.py*** this will generate the ***datafile.xlsx***.
* Then you can copy this file to the directory to run the project.
* I have done Excel creation using python to practice more of the OOPs concept of python.
