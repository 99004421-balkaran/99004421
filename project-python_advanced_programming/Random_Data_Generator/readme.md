# Generating random data using Python
This is the directory that has files that are used to generate the random data in the Excel file using Python. These python files generate an Excel file with the required five sheets. These five sheets are as given below
* Semester marks Sheet
* Random Hobbies Sheet
* Cities Visited Sheet
* Programming Expertise Sheet
* Domain Areas Sheet
## How data is generated
* To generate each sheet a python class is defined which will generate the data and write it to the Excel file.
* Each class receives the list of PS numbers from the main file and generate the random data according to the requirement.
* Then this randomly generated data is written to the Excel file using ***openpyxl*** library of python.
## Steps To Generate data 
* Get to this folder with GUI or command line.
* Then run the file named ***main_file.py*** this will generate the ***datafile.xlsx***.
* Then you can copy this file to the directory to run the project.
* I have done Excel creation using python to practice more of the OOPs concept of python.
