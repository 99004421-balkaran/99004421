# 99004421 Python Advanced Programming Project
This is the project created by me for Python Advanced Programming Module of the genesis. This project uses excel read and write operations to store random data created by the program. This data can is stored in the excel file using ***openpyxl*** libraray.
## Pytest and Pylint Working

## Steps to run the project
* To run the project you must have installed python and openpyxl library of python.
* To Install ***openpyxl*** use command ***pip install openpyxl***.
* After installing the openpyxl, run the Python file named ***main_project_file.py***.
* This will show all available PS numbers and ask for choose PS number to get output.
* After checking that input is valid it prints the data of PS number in tabular format and copies that data to the Excel file.
